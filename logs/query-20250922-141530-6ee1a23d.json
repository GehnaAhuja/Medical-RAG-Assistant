    "response": "Based on clinical guidelines and community knowledge: OP: My BP is always high at home but normal in clinic. Should I worry?\nReply: That might be white coat hypertension, but home readings matter.\nReply: Ask your doctor about ambulatory BP monitoring. # Hypertension Management\nHypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 140/90 mmHg. # Lifestyle Changes for Hypertension\nLifestyle measures can reduce blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg.\nThese include reducing salt, losing weight, exercising regularly, and managing stress.\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer: This is not medical advice.
